# NixOS configurations

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration files for various setups.

## homura

Temporary server running on an i3-6100.  
Configured to host a few services.  
Runs a hardened kernel.

## ui

Main desktop: a Ryzen 7 5800X with an RX 6700 XT.  
Configured for gaming, VR, and software development using Nix shells.  
Supports AppImages, has Android tools (adb + scrcpy), and runs on the Zen kernel.  
Implemented a fix for sleep issues on B550 motherboards.
